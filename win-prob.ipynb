    "# 5FR Win Probability\n",
    "### Author: Akshay Easwaran [akeaswaran@me.com](mailto:akeaswaran@me.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prereqs/Installation\n",
    "Read the README file for this repo to get the proper files downloaded and sorted locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's Included\n",
    "* Postgame win probability model -- linear regression based, predicting margin of victory based on the [Five Factors of Football](https://www.footballstudyhall.com/2014/1/24/5337968/college-football-five-factors). MoV has a normal distribution, so we can use the z-score of the predicted value to produce a win probability based on the team performance ratings generated from the statistics from the game.\n",
    "* Second-order wins: sum of a team's win probabilities; how many games a team should have won given their performances\n",
    "* Game Predictions (and validations): based on an adjustable number of a team's previous team performance ratings in a given year. Adjusted for P5 vs G5, overall strength of schedule, and conference strength of schedule. Note: the projected MOV produced is **NOT** adjusted by 2.5 for home-field advantage.\n",
    "* Schedule analysis: charts describing a given team's performance against projections and listing projections against a given set of teams\n",
    "* Team comparison charts: graphs comparing teams' 5FR rating over time\n",
    "* Historic rankings: a ranking of teams based on their mean 5FR. Not adjusted for strength of schedule or conference strength.\n",
